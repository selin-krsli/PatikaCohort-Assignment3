## What is the DTO Pattern ?
* DTOs or Data Transfer Objects are objects that carry data between processes in order to reduce the number of methods calls.
* The main purpose in DTO is to reduce the number of calls that can be made between the layers.
*  If the data we have in one layer will be used in the other layer, moving the data is a meaningful solution to avoid re-calls in the other layer.
* And Dto's contain almost no behavior. Dumb objects that transmit data as it is.
## What was used in this project ?
* In this project, DTO (Data Transfer Object) was used.
